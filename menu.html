                The traditional Indian recipe of Chicken Biryani contains lots of flavors and Indian spices. It is cooked using skinless chicken breast/thigh to reduce the cholesterol level. However, you should restrict its consumption, especially if you are worried about your waistline as the dish combines chicken and rice with rich seasonings that makes it a high-calorie dish.

Chicken Biryani tossed in ghee, stuffed with cashews is rich in protein as well as fat. The high amount of saturated fats in Chicken Biryani may enhance your cholesterol levels. The spices added to the Chicken Biryani may lead to acidity and heartburn.

On the other hand, being rich in protein, vitamin B6, and selenium, it can boost your bone strength, body metabolism, immune system and activity of the thyroid hormones. You can make Chicken Biryani healthier by using minimum oil and spices, brown rice and avoiding ghee.
